# Machine Learning

Creating an algorithm for a computer to run to find a mdoel hat fits the data, allowing for very accurate predictions.

Key:
- Don't provide the model a set of instructions
- Provide a target objective
 
There will be a certain level of accuracy that will be necessary. This will vary depending on the context of your project.

# Types of Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

Considering the archery example...

                    -> we know the target prior to the shot    
**labelled data**
                    -> we can associate that shot with a target

e.g. correct bad attempts

- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- Deep learning
- Bayesian networks
- Random forest models

## Unsupervised Learning

Say we have passed the model unlabelled arrows and ask the model to fire without providing targets.

The model is not going to tell us how to improve our accuracy of hitting the target:

It will divide the arrows in a certain way - clusters.

- K-means
- Deep learning
    - state of the art ML

## Reinforcment Learning

Every good fire, the model receives a reward => model tries to find best way to optimise how many rewards it gets.
