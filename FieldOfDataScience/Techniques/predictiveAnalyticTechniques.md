# Traditional Methods

## Linear Regression

A model used for quantifying causal relationships
among the different riables included in your analysis.

(Line of best fits `y = mx`)

## Logistic Regression

Algorithms to filter

Results are binary, 1 or 0 

## Cluster Analysis

When you can divide data into clusters rather than a linear line between
we can get more accurate data.

**Grouping observations together**

# Factor Analysis

 The case for many variable eg. consider what affects a house price
 => not just one `x` : `y = a + bx1 + cx2 + dx3 + ... + bnxmn`

 Can't do this for 100s or variables: We can apply Fcator Analysis

 e.g. results from a survey: Some answers will align up with others which we can combine into one variable

 **Grouping explanatory variables together**

 # Time Series

 Particularly big in economics and finance e.g. following a stock price

 - Plotting against time

 ## Examples:

- User Experience (UX)
    - cluster analysis: can often show us different demographics

 - Sales Forecasting
    - Time series analysis
